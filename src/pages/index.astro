            I'm a senior software engineer at Coolblue, where I build and
            maintain our logistics systems to ensure that your packages are
            "ordered today, delivered tomorrow".
        </p>
        <p>
            I design event-driven architectures with reliability in mind,
            grounded in domain-driven design and real-world business needs.
            Mostly on the back-end, but on the front-end too.
