                I'm a <strong>senior software engineer</strong> at Coolblue, where I build and
                maintain our logistics systems to ensure that your packages are
                "ordered today, delivered tomorrow".
            </p>
            <p>
                I design <strong>event-driven architectures</strong> with reliability in mind,
                grounded in domain-driven design and real-world business needs.
                Mostly on the back-end, but on the front-end too.
