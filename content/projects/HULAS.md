## HULAS in 60 Seconds

A "modern" web stack based on **H**TMX, **U**nix, **L**ua, **A**I (Chat-GPT) and **S**QLite

It's built upon the concepts of HATEOAS and CGI.

### Why?

1. I'm looking for an excuse to do something with HTMX.
2. I think CGI is a cool alternative way of building web apis
   - for the developer it's just a `print("<h1>Hello World</h1>")`

3. I don't like writing Javascript ðŸ˜¬
