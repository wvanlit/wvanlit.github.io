[Curious? Take a look at the GitHub repo](https://github.com/wvanlit/hulas-stack/)

## HULAS in 60 Seconds

A "modern" web stack based on **H**TMX, **U**nix, **L**ua, **A**I (Chat-GPT) and **S**QLite

It's built upon the concepts of [[HATEOAS]] and [[CGI]].

## Why?

1. I'm looking for an excuse to do something with HTMX.
2. I think [[CGI]] is a cool alternative way of building web apis, as for the developer it is as simple as `print("<h1>Hello World</h1>")`
3. It don't like Javascript ðŸ˜¬
