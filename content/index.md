I'm a Software Engineer who loves all things technology related.

In myÂ free time I like to [[Learning-in-Public/research/index|experiment with new technologies]] and [[Learning-in-Public/projects/index|make things]].

I'm currently working on:

* [[Learning-in-Public/projects/HULAS|HULAS]], an easy to use web stack built on HTMX, Lua & SQLite
* [[Learning-in-Public/projects/Tiny Rogue|Tiny Rogue]], a traditional rogue-like using a decoupled engine
* [[Learning-in-Public/projects/litdev.nl|litdev.nl]], this website!
