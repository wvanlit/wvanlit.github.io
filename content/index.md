I'm a Software Engineer who loves all things technology related.

In myÂ free time I like to [[learning-in-public/research/index|experiment with new technologies]] and [[learning-in-public/projects/index|make things]].

I'm currently working on:

- [[HULAS]], an easy to use web stack built on [[HTMX]], [[Lua]] & [[SQLite]]
- [[Tiny Rogue]], a traditional rogue-like using an engine built in [[FSharp|F]]
- [[litdev.nl]], this website!

In case you are interested you can view my [[Work Experience]]
