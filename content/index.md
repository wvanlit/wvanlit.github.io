I'm a Software Engineer who loves all things technology related.

In myÂ free time I like to [[content/Learning in Public/research/index|experiment with new technologies]] and [[content/Learning in Public/projects/index|make things]].

I'm currently working on:

- [[HULAS]], an easy to use web stack built on HTMX, Lua & SQLite
- [[Tiny Rogue]], a traditional rogue-like using an engine built in [[FSharp|F#]]
- [[litdev.nl]], this website!

In case you are interested you can view my [[Work Experience]]
